#### Who Am I? (... I am Jean Valjean!??)

I'm Jesse Orr, a second year student at Harris from **Baltimore, MD**.  Well, technically **Owings Mills, MD**, a suburb of Baltimore.

After finishing high school in Maryland, I first came to Chicago in 2011 when I began my UChicago career as an undergrad, where I lived in *Crown House* in South Campus.
