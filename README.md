#### Who Am I? (... I am Jean Valjean!??)

I'm Jesse Orr, a second year student at Harris from **Baltimore, MD**.  Well, technically **Owings Mills, MD**, a suburb of Baltimore.

After finishing high school in Maryland, I first came to Chicago in 2011 when I began my UChicago career as an undergrad, where I lived in *Crown House* in South Campus.

I knew that I wanted to learn a foreign language, and I already had taken Spanish all through school (plus, spoke it as a heritage speaker) so I began to take **Hindi**.  This would lead to all sorts of interesting life outcomes, and would keep me in the UChicago orbit...

As an undergrad, I was engaged in a few activities, namely:

1. ChoMUN
2. Team
3. MUNUC
