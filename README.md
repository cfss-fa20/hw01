All hail the great Ta'er, Lord of the Storm! Raised as Seth Markow in the humble coastal city of San Diego, Ta'er began preaching his gospel in the tundra city of Chicago, and soon his teachings became law, and spread across the world, ushering in a new era of peace and prosperity for the people of Earth. Now, as we venture further and further into the outer reaches of space, soon others, too, will know the goodness of Ta'er, Knower of the Way, Seer of the Future!

I've been reading Dune lately and it's definitely influenced me.
