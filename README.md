# Homework One (hw01)  
## By James Seddon  

### Goal: Edit ReadMe to Provide Introduction to Class,
_(as well as experimenting with R Markdown)_  


## Introduction  

Hello, dear viewer! My name is James Seddon, and I'm a 4^th^ year in the college studying Public Policy and Political Science. I warn you that, unlike my [favorite facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1349827481747511), graphic design is not my passion. This should explain why this markdown document is **bold**, but not in a good way.  

Here are three things you should know about me:  

1. My actual passion is scrolling through twitter at all hours of the day or night, because as we've learned recently, political news never sleeps.  
2. As a result of number one, my sleep schedule is now awfully screwed up.  
3. Despite a limited understanding of science and math, I am somehow still extremely interested in space! This has led me to become an astronomy and astrophysics minor here.  

## Look, I made a thing. I am very proud of it.
