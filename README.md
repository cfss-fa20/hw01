# Education
I studied psychology at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. I began participating in undergraduate research my freshman year and completed an Honors Thesis in my senior year. One of the *most* memorable experiences I had as an undergraduate was my study abroad in Greece. Below is a link to the study abroad page specific to my program. If you go under Student Testimonials, you will see the one I wrote!

# Future Plans  
I am interested in a career in applied behavioral research, specifically in consumer psychology. While I do not know exactly where I might like to work, I look forward to spending my MAPSS year exploring my options, acquiring relevant skills, and networking with faculty and students.
