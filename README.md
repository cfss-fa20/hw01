# Education
I studied psychology at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. I began participating in undergraduate research my freshman year and completed an Honors Thesis in my senior year. The experiences I had and the people I met over those for years were some of the best of my life. One of the *most* memorable was my study abroad in Greece. Below is a link to the study abroad page specific to this program. If you go under Student Testimonials, you will see the one I wrote!
