## Hello there! 

My name is Julia Pruin and I am a new MAPSS student here at UChicago. I am concentrating in Psychology and working with [Dr. Monica Rosenberg](https://psychology.uchicago.edu/directory/monica-rosenberg) for my thesis. I plan to research the cognitive measures that might be used to predict changing ADHD diagnoses in an adolescent sample. 

## Some Fun Facts

 - I am originally from San Antonio, TX and this is my first time living outside Texas.
 - I love to bake and cook. If I am stressed, I make cookies or bread.
 - I am not allergic to mosquitoes. I still get bit, but I don't itch or swell.
 - I have a pitbull. Her name is Hayley. She is a baby and I miss her very much.

## Some Progress Notes
 - I really didn't pay enough attention the first time that I learned how to fork from github in June. I have been spoiled by downloading from Box for the last few months and so I had to *entirely* relearn the process.
 - I was always curious as to how R for Data Science and other R things were made pretty for the web. Now I know that it was just R Markdown. Neat.
 - I found a cheatsheet that I had high hopes for because I keep a nice one for ggplot, but [this thing](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf?_ga=2.40532778.94379362.1601512842-120555137.1591728115) is a monster and it makes me sad. :unamused:
