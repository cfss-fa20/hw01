# Homework One (hw01)  
## By James Seddon  

### Goal: Edit ReadMe to Provide Introduction to Class,
_(as well as experimenting with R Markdown)_  


## Introduction  

Hello, dear viewer! My name is James Seddon, and I'm a 4^th^ year in the college studying Public Policy and Political Science. I warn you that, unlike my [favorite facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1349827481747511), graphic design is not my passion. This should explain why this markdown document is **bold**, but not in a good way.  

Here are three things you should know about me:  

1. My actual passion is scrolling through twitter at all hours of the day or night, because as we've learned recently, political news never sleeps.  
2. As a result of number one, my sleep schedule is now awfully screwed up.  
3. Despite a limited understanding of science and math, I am somehow still extremely interested in space! This has led me to become an astronomy and astrophysics minor here.  

#### Look, I made a thing. I am very proud of it.

#### If you've read this far, you deserve a photo of a cat.

I present this without comment, as I hope it needs none.  

## Reflection  

Overall, this assignment was rather challenging. To be honest, I struggled more with the formatting markdown version of the assignment than I did with the git and github sections. The table was an especially big challenge for me due to this very fact. My guess is that my insistence to measure once and cut ~seventeen~ a few times will be a running theme of a challenge for myself in this course. The easy solution, of course, is to slow down while reading and not be so hasty, so I need to keep that in the back of my mind. The most useful tutorial was, of course, the course website, but a close second is the RMd formatting guide embedded in R. If I paid attention to it, it would have (as mentioned previously) saved me a massive headache.  

## Process  
All changes to the README file were done inside RStudio (for desktop). In sum, I forked the homework repository, then created a new project from Git using the RStudio commands. From this, I then edited the README.md document in RStudio, testing various formatting things with the preview function in RStudio. From there, I kept committing using the commit box, and occasionally pushing my changes back to github using the push button in RStudio.
