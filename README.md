My name is Leyi Kang. I am a master student studying psychology in the Social Sciences Division. I just graduated from the University of Rochester this May, and I look forward to delving deeper into psychology research on child and adolescent psychopathology at UChicago. My long-term goal is to apply for either clinical or developmental psychology PhD after I graduate from here.
