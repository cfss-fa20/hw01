My name is **Kaitlyn Van Baalen**. I am a third year Public Policy major and Statistics minor at the college.

## Interests

Some of my interests include:
* Running - I am a part of the varsity cross country and track teams at the university. I focus on a few events:
  * 800 meters
  * 1500 meters
  * One mile
* Education - I have worked as a tutor in many different subjects and for several different educational nonprofits, because I have a passion for equitable education.
* Reading - I love a good book of almost any genre, but fantasy and nonfiction memoirs are some of my particular favorites.
* Politics - When I'm not listening to an audiobook, I'm probably listening to a political podcast. I try to make some time each week for political volunteering.
* Travel - Whenever it is safe to travel again, I have an evergrowing list of places I'd love to go.

## Goals
I'm excited to take CFSS because I've learned done data analysis in my statistics classes, but I want to know *how* to get the data to the point where it can be analyzed. In the real world, I know it isn't as simple as downloading a pristine file from Canvas. I think this will be useful for me as I hope to work in policy research in the future.
