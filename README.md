# My name is **Rachel Sass**. Here are a few things about me!

## A bit about me

#### I am from Irvine, California, and I went to college at UCLA. My majors were History and Political Science. Last year, I lived in Washington, DC, where I worked at a non-profit that provides pro bono legal services to residents with debt crises. I'm hoping to do policy research in the future, so I'm excited to gain social science computing skills in this class.

## Some of the things I like to do in my free time are:

* Going on bike rides
* Listening to political podcasts
* Hanging out with my girlfriend
* Drinking coffee and eating good desserts
* Exploring wherever I am
