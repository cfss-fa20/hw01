## Ruben Heuer


>My name is **Ruben Heuer** and I'm a graduate student in the MAPSS program. Until very recently, I have lived in Berlin, Germany, where I worked as a physical therapist for about eight years after studying musicology and German literature. Over the course of my medical career I decided to go back into academia, where I focused on the intersection of cognitive science and medicine. While writing my BA thesis on philosophical implications of a [predictive processing](https://predictive-mind.net) perspective on clinical medicine, I dabbled a bit in R and (mostly frequentist) statistics, so I'm really looking forward to intensify my engagement with programming in the future.

When I am not working on my homework assignments I like to...

* playing videogames
* engage in various physical activities, such as...
  + running along Lake Michigan
  + hopefully I'll get back to bouldering soon

This is a picture of myself in Ocean Park, Hongkong, wearing a *fashionable* panda hat:
