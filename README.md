**_Actual Summary_**

Hello all! My name is Emily, and I am PhD Candidate in the history department here at UChicago. I work on historical epidemics of microbial disease (specifically plague, tuberculosis, and typhoid fever) across the British Empire. Because I am such a disease nerd, I am also working on an MSc in Public Health Science, so I can get a handle on epidemiological modeling and analysis. 

I just returned from 18 months of dissertation research in the UK, India, and Australia, which led to some very cool moments, like these:

Outside of work, I love to hike and hang out with my dog and cat. I also edit a feminist environmental history blog called [Environmental History Now](https://envhistnow.com/). We try to showcase the work of female-identifying early career scholars across environmental studies. It was started by a BU student named Elizabeth Hameeteman, and has grown into something pretty remarkable - I recommend checking it out!
