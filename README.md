Hello, World! My name is Kwabene Kalumbula.

For this, my first assignment in MACS 30500: Computing for the Social Sciences, I have been instructed to provide a short biograpghy. Thus, as the leader of a band of cartoon scallions once said: "Allow [me] to introduce [myself]." ![image of scallion](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/027/174/veggie.jpg)

#### Education

* I was homeschooled K-12 (basically, this means that I was familiar with the above quote long before it became a meme)
* I am now a third-year undergraduate at UChicago majoring in Sociology
* While I have had to perform simple tasks in RStudio before, my computing experience is *very* limited. 

#### Fun Facts

* My name comes from a saying which, in a nutshell, means "Shut up and eat." (African proverb)
* I hope to someday retire and start a capybara farm
* I currently own kwabene.com but don't know what to do with it
