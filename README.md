## About Me
My name is Ming Cui. I received my master's degree in business administration from University of Science and Technology of China. I am working on my master's in social sciences at UChicago.

## Why this course?
**Computational tools** are trending. You may find

1. Computational Neuroscience
1. Computational Biology
1. Computational Sociology
1. Computational Psychology
1. Computational Economics

and more...

As a learner in social sciences, it is really the time to study computational methods.

## Things I have learned so far
How to use Git workflow. I also found `<fork>` an interesting term. You may find [this website](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows) useful for understanding `<fork>`.

## What is next?
Week 1 is pretty informative. I cannot wait for the incoming lectures.
