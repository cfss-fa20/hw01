##### My COVID Summer

This summer I worked as an intern for the Brookings Institution, and the United Nations Development Program for Africa where I conducted research on the Effect of COVID-19 on Africa. It was an extreemly fulfiling internship, and below is the link to some of my work at The [Brookings Institute](https://harris.uchicago.edu/admissions/blog/my-summer-internship-brookings-institute)

##### My Reflection

This excersise was not too cumbersome once I understood what I was doing (Thanks to Debi) I thought that once the final document was produced it would look a bit different/more aestetically pleaseing but I guess not. Hopefully I did the assignment properly as I followed the instructions from the cheat sheet. Alltogether I thought this was a good excersise, and I think it is a lot easier for me to produce my code locally rather than through the server.
