Hi everyone, my name is Emily Robb and I'm a fourth year in the College. I'm double-majoring in Philosophy and Political Science and am incredibly excited to take this course and learn practical skills that I haven't really had previous exposure to. Looking forward to learning with all of you!

##### Process Description
I started this homework by reviewing the overview and instructions, and ultimately watching the accompanying video.

[Panopto Instructions](https://uchicago.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=7bd284fa-ceac-400b-a8db-ab9500f8d943&start=199.610526)

I clicked the **code** button at the top of the page and forked my own copy of the hw01 file in order to edit it. 

Next, I cloned my fork to my own computer. This process has a couple of steps that I took.

1. Clicked the green clone button

2. Copied the link to my clipboard

3. Opened RStudio and created a new *version control* project using the repository URL copied in the last step

To finish the rest of this homework up, I clicked on the README.md file and started writing in it with Markdown, adding different stylistic elements, and even uploading an image.

I really liked this homework assignment and the overall simplicity of Markdown. The GitHub workflow was definitely pretty clunky and confusing at first but I think it will become more natural with more practice over time!

##### Submission

Once all of this was completed, I started the process of submitting my assignment. I did this by clicking the save button in order to save the file. Then, I clicked the Diff button to see the differences I've input. Next, I staged the changes, wrote myself a note in the commit message field, clicked the commit button, and pushed the changes up to Github with the green up arrow.

To finish all this up I will be creating a new pull request to signal that my homework is done.
