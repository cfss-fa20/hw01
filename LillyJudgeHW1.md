## Reasons for taking this class:

Though I expect most of my research to involve ethnographic methods, I want to be able to understand other work (particularly statistically oriented work) and at least have a baseline ability to collaborate with other social scientists if my methodological predelictions shift later in my career. I have messed around on datacamp and using R itself a little bit but have no more than a passing familiarity with what we're currently doing in the class.

## Reflections on HW1

I found this to be fairly confusing; I did it incorrectly at first after looking up the R-Markdown cheat sheet on Google. My initial process was as follows:

1. I downloaded the .zip file from GitHub and unzipped it.
2. I opened the .md file in R using File --> New File --> R Markdown
3. I saved the file as README
4. I began editing/writing in the file.

The only part I found difficult was inserting a picture; I couldn't figure out what path R Markdown wanted. After plumbing google for answers, the word "Directory" started coming up a lot. After looking into what exactly a Directory was, I realized I'd done the whole process wrong. 

My second attempt followed the following process:

1. I cloned the repository and downloaded it to my desktop GitHub.
2. I created a R Markdown document and copied my R Markdown code from my previous attempt into that window.
3. I re-saved the title as my name.
4. I am about to Commit the R Markdown code to Git.

Hoping it works but not at all confident I did this correctly.
