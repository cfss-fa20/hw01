My name is Mackenzie Whitfield.  
I moved to Chicago from San Diego two weeks ago. I **love** the beach. Up until now, I have only lived in California.

# Where I have Lived  
1. San Diego

# Education
I studied psychology at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. I began participating in undergraduate research my freshman year and completed an Honors Thesis in my senior year. The experiences I had and the people I met over those for years were some of the best of my life. One of the *most* memorable was my study abroad in Greece.
