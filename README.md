## **About me**
Hi! My name is **Zhilan Fang**. I'm a MAPSS student with a concentration in Sociology. I'm from China and will stay in [UChicago Beijing Center](https://www.uchicago.cn/) during the fall quarter. I'm broadly interested in topics about *inequality, social media, and opinion formation*. I'm looking forward to learning more computational skills in this course and applying them to my studies.
