## Sean Ennis Biography

Hello Friends! My name is Sean Ennis and I am a third year **Public Policy Studies** major and am undecided if I want to pursue a **Joint BA** degree or a **Human Rights** minor _though I am running out of time to decide_.

Some of my academic and non-academic interests are:

* Academic
  * Politics, I recommend [fivethirtyeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com)
  * Domestic and International Economic Policy
  * Human Rights Law
* Personal
  * Reality Competition Shows
  * Podcasts
  * Football

I've been completely let down by _Big Brother 22_ this season, so I just want to give a shout-out to Queen Da'Vonne Rogers ![BB22 Da'Vonne](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcRkYDO1oMoinwifbh8m8kajXJftZLVKKIO6Lg&usqp=CAU)
