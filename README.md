Hello, World! My name is Kwabene Kalumbula.

For this, my first assignment in MACS 30500: Computing for the Social Sciences, I have been instructed to provide a short biograpghy. Thus, as the leader of a band of cartoon scallions once said: "Allow [me] to introduce [myself]." ![image of scallion](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/027/174/veggie.jpg)

#### Education

* I was homeschooled K-12 (basically, this means that I was familiar with the above quote long before it became a meme)
* I am now a third-year undergraduate at UChicago majoring in Sociology
* While I have had to perform simple tasks in RStudio before, my computing experience is *very* limited. ![is this computer science?](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44856f0611a6ae5e8f4e1875772d8f462a7e6f10/0_139_1118_671/master/1118.jpg?width=620&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7b41ac986fb0e6e8a8674946a915263d)

#### Fun Facts

* My name comes from a saying which, in a nutshell, means "Shut up and eat." (African proverb)
