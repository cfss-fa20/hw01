# Biography: Madison Martin 

I usually go by Madison in school, but I also go by *Maddie* as well. 
I like both, so feel free to call me whichever is easiest! 
I am a MAPSS student pursuing the Computational Social Science certificate, which is how I found this course. 
My research interests are prejudice and discrimination, based on race/ethnicity or disability, in organizational contexts like the workplace or in education. 
During my time in this course, and over the MAPSS program in general, I am hoping to: 

1. gain coding skills by being introduced to the R programming language

2. utilize these new programming-focused skills in the process of creating my master's thesis project 

3. expand my knowledge and understanding of the role data plays in social science

In my spare time, I recently have been collecting pins and learning about fashion history. 
~~But, when we are not in a pandemic~~, I also like to sing, volunteer at animal shelters, and go to concerts (House of Blues is my **favorite** venue ever).
