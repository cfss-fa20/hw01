## Self Introduction: Stan Xie

Hello, I am **Stan Xie**, and am pursuing a master degree of arts in public policy with certificate in research methods at Harris. Prior to joining Harris, I received a bachelorâ€™s degree in economics from Peking University, where I discovered a strong interest in social science research. My research interests include development economics, behavioral economics and political economy. 

Specifically, I mainly focus on these topics below:

* Social image
* Social interaction
* Social norm
* Trust, belief and attitudes

Last summer, I was a **DRW** fellow working as a summer RA at The Energy Policy Institute at UChicago (*EPIC*). And here is the link where I summerized my work there.

Lastly, I am happy to share my headshot with you, which I took one year ago. During this pandemic period, it is a pity that we cannot sit together in the classroom. Hope everything will be done very soon!
