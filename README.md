## Emma Gilheany
### Week 1 Comp for Social Science

I am a 5th year PhD student in Anthropology who has **absolutely no** programming experience. My dissertation is a *qualitative and creative* humanistic inquiry into the recent history of Hopedale, Nunatsiavut. Here is a [somewhat outdated summary](https://cissr.uchicago.edu/research/2018-2019/field-research/emma-gilheany) of what I am working on. Lately, I am fascinated by
* Cold War bases in the Arctic built by Americans and the USSR to surveil for missiles
* US experiments with climate and *recreating* Arctic climates for combat-training purposes
* Why Americans view Canada as a place with somehow better politics than the US, **despite** glaring evidence to the contrary, particularly concerning Canada's treatment of indigenous people
Here is a picture of what the Hopedale radar base looked like in the 1960s ![Image of radar base] (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/RCAF_Station_Hopedale_-_1964-1965.jpg)
